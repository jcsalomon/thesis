Optimal Control Blog
====================

In order to encourage myself to work more regularly on my Master’s thesis,
I’d decided to keep a more-or-less public journal about the effort.
That was in May of 2009.
I started a WordPress blog which I sporadically updated.

Why WordPress?
Because they could handle (Lᴬ)Τεχ-like math,
and a blog about Control Theory is going to be heavy on math.

But entering the math quickly became a pain.
And running a local copy of WordPress is difficult
so I couldn’t draft posts offline very well.
And the editing interface is clumsy.
And…

And I was using GitHub for my thesis anyway,
and they’ve got this lovely feature called [GitHub Pages][pages].

It took some time to create a theme I was happy with,
but a combination of [HTML 5][html5], [Jekyll][jekyll], & [MathJax][mathjax]
have made this possible.

(Feel free to adapt the layout code for your own use.)

On my to-do list for this blog are these things I had on WordPress
that I haven’t yet figured out how to emulate in Jekyll:

* Categories list & Tags cloud,
* Incorporation of the “Recent commits” Atom feed, and
* Comments.

Suggestions for any of these are welcome.
