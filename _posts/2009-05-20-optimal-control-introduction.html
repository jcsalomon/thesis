  In order to encourage myself to work more regularly on my Master’s thesis,
  I’ve decided to keep a more-or-less public journal about the effort.
</p>

<p>
  So here is the basic plan behind
  <em>Control Systems for the Lunar Lander X-Prize Challenge</em>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work through the math for the soft-landing problem;</li>
  <li>Ditto for the attitude control problem; and, if I have enough time,</li>
  <li>Unify the two problems, probably using Geometric Algebra.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Sounds easy, don’t it?
</p>

<p>
  My basic text is Donald E. Kirk’s
  <a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0136380980"><em>Optimal Control Theory:
      An Introduction</em></a>
  from the Prentice-Hall Networks series.
  At the Cooper Union, Professor Shinners used his own
  <a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0471318574"><em>Advanced Modern Control System
      Theory and Design</em></a>,
  which whetted my appetite for the subject,
  but left me dangling when I tried to actually follow his derivations.
