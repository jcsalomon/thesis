title:   "Statement of the Problem"
summary: "The objective of optimal control theory is
          to determine the control signals that will cause a process
          to satisfy the physical constraints and at the same time
          minimize (or maximize) some performance criterion."

<p>
  Kirk describes optimal control thus:
</p>

<blockquote>
  The objective of optimal control theory is
  <em>to determine the control signals that will cause a process
    to satisfy the physical constraints and at the same time
    minimize </em>(<em>or maximize</em>)<em> some performance criterion</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
  He then requires three things for the formulation of an optimal control problem:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>A mathematical model of the process we wish to control;</li>
  <li>A statement of the constraints on the system &amp; controls; and</li>
  <li>Specification of a performance criterion.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Iâ€™ll get into a discussion of these terms next post.
