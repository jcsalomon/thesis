  To model a system, we want
  “the simplest mathematical description that adequately predicts
  the response of the system to all anticipated inputs.”
</p>

<p>
  We restrict our discussion to systems described by
  ordinary differential equations in state variable form.
  Wikipedia has a decent overview of state space
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space_(controls)">here</a>,
  and the notation I’ll be using is pretty similar.
</p>

<p>
  If \( x_1(t), x_2(t), …, x_n(t) \) are the <em>state variables</em>
  (or the <em>states</em>) of the process at time \( t \),
  and \( u_1(t), u_2(t), …, u_m(t) \) are <em>control inputs</em>
  to the process at time \( t \),
  then we can describe the system by
  \( n \) first-order differential equations thus:
\[
  \begin{aligned}
  \dot{x_1}(t) &= a_1(x_1(t), x_2(t), …, x_n(t), u_1(t), u_2(t), …, u_m(t), t) \\
  \dot{x_2}(t) &= a_2(x_1(t), x_2(t), …, x_n(t), u_1(t), u_2(t), …, u_m(t), t) \\
  {}           & ⋮ \\
  \dot{x_n}(t) &= a_n(x_1(t), x_2(t), …, x_n(t), u_1(t), u_2(t), …, u_m(t), t).
  \end{aligned}
\]
</p>

<p>
  Now define the state and control vectors
\[
  \def\avec{\boldsymbol a} \def\uvec{\boldsymbol u} \def\xvec{\boldsymbol x}
  \xvec(t) := \begin{bmatrix} x_1(t) \\ x_2(t) \\ ⋮ \\ x_n(t) \end{bmatrix}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \uvec(t) := \begin{bmatrix} u_1(t) \\ u_2(t) \\ ⋮ \\ u_n(t) \end{bmatrix}.
\]
  The state equation can now be rewritten as
\[
  \dot\xvec = \avec(\xvec(t), \uvec(t), t)
\]
  where the definition of \( \avec \) is apparent.

  Next time, a word on system & control constraints.
