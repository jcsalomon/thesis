# Joel Salomon’s in-progress Master of Engineering thesis

This is an experiment.  Taking a cue from Will Robertson’s work on his PhD thesis, I’m making my work public here and on my blog, <http://optimalcontrol.wordpress.com/>.  This should help me be more accountable by letting anyone (read: my advisor) see when I am or am not working.

## LaTeX compilation

I’ve decided to stick with XɘTeX as my engine of choice, although I might consider LuaTeX eventually. At any rate, Will Robertson’s [`unicode-math`](http://github.com/wspr/unicode-math/) has recently been added to [TeX Live 2010](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) (currently in [pretest](http://www.tug.org/texlive/pretest.html)) and I’m using it heavily.

I’m also using Philip G. Ratcliffe’s unreleased `foreign` and `xpunctuate` packages; contact him if you want the files.
