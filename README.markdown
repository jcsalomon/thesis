# Joel Salomon’s in-progress Master of Engineering thesis

This is an experiment.  Taking a cue from Will Robertson’s work on his PhD thesis, I’m making my work public here and on my blog, <http://optimalcontrol.wordpress.com/>.  This should help me be more accountable by letting anyone (read: my advisor) see when I am or am not working.

## LaTeX compilation

I’m using some experimental and in-developement packages which are not yet in [TeX Live 2009](http://www.tug.org/texlive/), including Philipp Lehman’s [`biblatex`](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/biblatex.html) and Will Robertson’s [`unicode-math`](http://github.com/wspr/unicode-math/), although I’ve got some conditional code in place so as not to require XɘTeX.
